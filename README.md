# Predicting Baseball Player OPS

This Jupyter Notebook focuses on predicting the On-base Plus Slugging (OPS) of baseball players in future seasons using historical data. The project demonstrates skills in data acquisition, cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using Python.

## Features

- **Data Acquisition:** Utilizes the `pybaseball` library to gather comprehensive batting statistics from 2000 to 2024.
- **Data Filtering:** Filters data to include players with multiple seasons for more accurate predictions.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates features such as future OPS (`Next_OPS`) to facilitate predictive analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Employs machine learning techniques to predict players' future OPS (assuming modeling is included).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `pybaseball`, `os`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predicting-ops.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd predicting-ops
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook predictingOPS.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

1. **Load Data:** Run the cells to load historical batting statistics.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Execute the feature engineering steps to prepare data for modeling.
3. **Run Analysis:** Follow the notebook steps to analyze and predict player OPS.

## Project Structure

- **Data Acquisition:** Fetches and saves batting statistics using `pybaseball`.
- **Data Cleaning and Filtering:** Processes and filters data for relevant player statistics.
- **Feature Engineering:** Constructs additional features to aid in prediction.
- **Modeling and Prediction:** Implements machine learning algorithms to predict OPS.

### Suggestions for Improvement and Future Plans

1. **Include Visualizations:**
   - Add sections in the notebook for visualizing key statistics and correlations, which can provide insights into the data.

2. **Modeling and Evaluation:**
   - Clearly outline the predictive modeling approach and evaluation metrics used to assess model performance.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - Provide insights and interpretations of the model results and any patterns observed in the data.
